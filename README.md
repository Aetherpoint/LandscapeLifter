# Terace
Terace is an iPhone app for quickly generating architectural 3D sketches through your camera. 

# WRLDGenerator
WRLDGenerator generates sketches from `WRLD.JSON` files created with [Terace](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terace/id1492035680?ls=1) app.

## Setup
1. Drag `WRLDGenerator` into your Unity project.
2. Add the `WRLD Builder` script to a gameobject.
3. Add a `WRLD.JSON` file from Terace to the WRLDfile variable in the inspector.
4. Assign the `WRLD_Mesh` prefab to Terrain and `WRLD_Cube` prefab to Wall.

Click Build Structures to generate the sketch!

## Dependencies
`WRLD File` – The JSON file used to generate the sketch.

`Terrain` – The prefab we spawn for the terrain. Can be any gameobject, but requires a child with a Mesh Renderer and Mesh Filter.

`Wall` – The prefab we spawn for each structure brick. Can be any gameobject, but assumes a mesh with a basic cube.

## Actions
`Build Structures` – Generates the structure, executes in edit mode, not runtime. Will create structures and children game objects, and a separate gameobject (`wrld_meshHolder`) holding the terrain so you can move it independently.

`Build Structures` – Clears each structures generated by WRLDGenerator.

## Settings
`Structure Max Height` – Y Scale of the structures.


`Terrain Scale` – Total scale of the generated terrain.

`Terrain Height` – Y height of the terrain.

`Terrain Steps` – Number of levels for the terrain.
